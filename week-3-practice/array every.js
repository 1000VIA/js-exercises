/* you are supposed to create a program that check vegan food.
This program should check if the array “group” contains only vegan food .
This would be helpful for  vegan persons when they want to check their plates ‘ ingredients*/

var vegan = ["Aubergine", "courgette", "rice", "eggs", "olives"];
var group = ["Aubergine", "courgette", "butter", "rice", "eggs"];

if (groupIsOnlyVegan) {
    console.log("The group contains only vegan");
} else {
    console.log("The group does not contain only vegan");
}

// complete this statement
var groupIsOnlyVegan = false;

//Expected results
// “the group does not contain only vegan” (edited)
