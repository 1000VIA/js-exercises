### More objects!

Did you know you can assign arrays to object properties? And even other objects? Or variables?

```js
var kittenName = "Feathers";

var kitten = {
    name: kittenName,
    toyCollection: ['blue ball', 'green ball', 'hoover box'],
    favoriteLocation: {
        roomName: 'Living room',
        napPlace: 'window',
        idealTemperatureCelsius: 24
    }
};
```
