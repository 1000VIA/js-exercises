### Goals

- introduce objects as a concept
- when can we use objects (to store what type of information)
- the very specific object syntax (the commas after each property, the colon between property name and value, the curly brackets)
- the language to use when talking about an objects: object literal, properties, property names, property values
- reading object properties using the *dot notation*: `console.log(myObject.name)`
- setting object properties: `myObject.name = "John"`
- very simple exercises to get them used to declaring object literals, reading and writing from/to them
