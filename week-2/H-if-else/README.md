An if statement runs code when a condition is met. What is the condition is not met? Sometimes you want to run an alternative bit of code.

An **if...else statement** also runs code when the condition is _not_ met.

```js
var isHappy = true;

if (isHappy) {
  console.log("I am happy ðŸ˜„");
} else {
  console.log("I am not happy ðŸ˜¢");
}
```
