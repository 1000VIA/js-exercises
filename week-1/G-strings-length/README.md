You can find out how many characters there are in a string by using the `length` property of a string:

```js
var name = "Daniel";
var nameLength = fullName.length;

console.log(fullNameLength); // Logs 6
```

## Exercise

* Log a message that includes the length of your name

## Expected result

```
My name is Daniel and my name is 6 characters long
```
