// Exercise 2

/* 
  You are given an array of names of musical artists.
  Find the first artist whose name starts with S 
  and is shorter than 5 letters (who is also, coincidentally, the best artist from the array!)
*/

var namesOfMusicalArtists = ["Prince", "Elvis", "Sade", "Beatles", "Madonna", "Adele"];

// write your code here
var shortNameThatStartsWithS;


// Expected output = "Sade"
//
//BTW, Yes Sade is the best artist from that array.  It's a close call between her and Prince, 
//but donâ€™t start talking to me about Adele, please.
