// You have an array of names:

var names = ['Abdullah', 'Ahmed', 'Ahmet', 'Alisina', 'Bart', 'Clement', 'Deepa', 'Elamin', 
             'Ermiyas', 'Ismail', 'Ivina', 'Joan', 'Kadir', 'Madiha', 'Matthew', 'Miles', 
             'Mohammad', 'Mohbeen', 'Mussie', 'Najla', 'Nina', 'Samantha', 'Sola', 'Tayo', 'Zareen']

/* 
You know that Abz is shortened from his full name "Abdullah", 
and Bart is shortened from "Bartholomew" 
(Yes, my parents did that to me and high school was FULL 
of Simpsons and biblical reference jokes before you ask).

You want to check if the the array has any names that look like they might be shortened.
*/

// PART 1: Write a function that checks for names of 4 characters or less.

// write code here
var shortNames;

// PART 2: Use another array method to check that ALL of the names
// in shortNames are under 5 characters in length.

// write code here

// Expected output = 'true'
