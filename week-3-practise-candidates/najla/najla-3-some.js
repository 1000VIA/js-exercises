/* you are supposed to create a program that check vegan food.
This program should check if the array “group” contains only vegan food .
This would be helpful for  vegan persons when they want to check their plates ‘ ingredients*/

var vegan = ["Aubergine", "courgette", "rice", "eggs", "olives"];
var group = [ "Aubergine", "courgette", "butter", "rice", "veggs"];
var groupIsOnlyVegan; // complete this statement

/* expected results 
// “the group does not contain only vegan”
*/
