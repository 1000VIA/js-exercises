/*
In this exercise, Mr Very Important Boss Man (Mr VIBM) has a very important job for you!

- First, he wants you to remove any candidates from his list of email addresses 
and names that include the word 'spam'. 
Use the .filter() function!

- Then he wants you to sort the candidates so that candidate1 is first, candidate 2 is second and so on.
Use the .sort() function!

- Finally, Mr VIBM wants you to use the .forEach() function to console log the sorted arrays with formatting 
like this:

'Email address: candidate1@jobmail.com Dear Gaius your interview is at this time: 10:00'

Remember: the .forEach() method tracks the index of every array item in the second parameter by
default!
