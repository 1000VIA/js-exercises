In the game, players make words  arranged from letters.

Different letters are worth different points.

Each word is scored by summing the points for each of its letters.

Example: The word 'happy' would score 10 points because:

| Letter | Score |
| ------ | ----- |
| H      |    3  |
| A      |    1  |
| P      |    2  |
| P      |    2  |
| Y      |    2  |
| total  | = 10  |

(3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 10)
