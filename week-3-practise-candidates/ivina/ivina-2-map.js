/* Everybody knows I love animals! So I have decided to check if all small animals has a short name.
You should create a function that runs through the array and check if the name length is equal or less than 4.
If it's smaller or equal than 4 it should print the name and the message saying that x animal has a short name.
If the name is longer print a  message saying that is a long name and the name of the animal
 Hint: Use map to solve this problem. */
