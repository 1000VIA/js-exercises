/* 
Everybody knows I love animals! So I have decided to check if all small animals have a short name.

For each name, check if the name length is equal or less than 4, and make a message in a new array.

If it's smaller or equal than 4 you should show the name and the message saying that x animal has a short name.

If the name is longer make a message saying that is a long name, and the name of the animal.

Look carefully at the expected result.
