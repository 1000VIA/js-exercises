//Exercise 2:
//GOAL LINE TECHNOLOGY
//Football has introduced a new technology that tells if the ball has crossed the line or not.
//To validate a goal, the ball most entirely (100%) cross the goal line.
//a 99% cross is  no goal.
//The program does just that; It tells if there is a goal or not.
//percentageCrossed is an array with the percentage of the ball over the line
var percentageCrossed = ["2%", "90%", "47%", "23%", "100%", "86%", "100%"];
//Write a function that print the result of each of these percentage crossed as "GOOOOAL" or "NO GOAL";
//Expected Results
//NO GOAL
//NO GOAL
//NO GOAL
//NO GOAL
//GOOOOAL
//NO GOAL
//GOOOOAL
