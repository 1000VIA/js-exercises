  Following on from exercise 1...
  The travellers have safely landed and are foraging for food in the natural wildlife.
  There are bushes with many different colour berries.
  The pink berries are the ONLY safe one's to eat.
  If any other berries are present, it's best not to eat from the bush at all!
  Using .every(), determine, if the bush has ALL PINK berries and is safe for the astronauts to eat from the bush.
