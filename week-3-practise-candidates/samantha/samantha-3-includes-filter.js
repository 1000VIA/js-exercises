  Continuing on from Exercise 2...
  The voyagers decide that they quite like this planet, and some of them want to settle there and colonise it.
  They decide that the all the families (whose last names starts with 'A') should stay, while the others go on in search of home or other land.
  Use .includes() find families.
  Using .filter() make a new array of colonisers that will stay.
