var isHappy = "false";

if (isHappy == true) {
  console.log("I am happy");
} else {
  console.log("I am not happy");
}
make sure both same typeof, eg: a string/ boolean. 

two equals means a question. one equals mean just assign right to the Left.

/* 
  EXPECTED RESULT
  ---------------
  I am not happy
*/
